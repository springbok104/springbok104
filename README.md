# 👋 Hey, I'm Robert

I’m a Systems Administrator returning to tech with a focus on building, optimising, and managing infrastructure that works. From Cape Town to the cloud, my journey has spanned systems engineering, automation, and scripting solutions designed to make tech more accessible, resilient, and user-conscious. These days, I’m diving into DevOps workflows and Python development one practical step at a time.

## 🛠️ What I'm Into These Days

**Currently exploring:**
- Learning the ropes of IaC with Bicep and hybrid CI/CD pipelines  
- Dockerized utilities for sysadmin tasks and monitoring setups  
- Inclusive transformation strategies in South Africa’s tech space  
- Automation that balances transparency, reliability, and user context  

**Also enjoy:**
- Learning how tech decisions shape user experiences and expectations  
- Mapping systems from the ground up. Logic, flow, and real constraints  
- Curiosity about the invisible tech that keeps our lives ticking  
- Occasionally tinkering with microcontrollers, dashboards, and home-grown tools
