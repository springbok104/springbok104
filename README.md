## üëã Hi, I'm Robert

I'm a systems administrator returning to my technical roots. I‚Äôve worked across Windows Server, PowerShell automation, and secure infrastructure, and I‚Äôm currently leaning into DevOps, Python, and cloud tooling. This GitHub reflects that transition, with real-world scripts, lessons learned, and projects in motion.

### üõ†Ô∏è Current interests:
- Building real-world utility scripts
- Tidying systems through automation
- Learning out loud (mistakes included)

### üìö Featured Projects
Check out my [PowerShell tools](https://github.com/springbok104/powershell-tools) - a curated mix of practical and archival scripts.
